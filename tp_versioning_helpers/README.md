# TP versioning helpers
## Description
I coded myself the scripts named *makeSubmission.sh* and *newTP.sh* for my own work, although **anyone can use them for their work** as they contain no personal information.

## How to use
These scripts are regularly updated, and they've been commented so anyone knows how to use them.


**Remember to set the constant variables at the top of each script, labelled as *Configuration*, they can be useful if you want the scripts to use the right username, and the right folders on your machine!!**

## Compile
There's nothing to compile, folks. These are standalone **bash** scripts.
